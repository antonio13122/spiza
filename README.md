## Description
At Spiza, we're on a mission to make Pula a more sustainable and compassionate community. Our platform connects people in need in the town of Pula with local restaurants, bakeries, and shops that have surplus food they would otherwise throw away. By redistributing this excess food to those who need it most, we aim to reduce food waste, promote sustainability, and help alleviate hunger in our community. Every day, countless nutritious meals are needlessly wasted, while many individuals and families struggle to put food on the table. Spiza bridges this gap by facilitating the donation of surplus food to those facing food insecurity. Together, we can create a more equitable and environmentally conscious society.
## Key Features

1. **Food Waste Sharing**: Facilitate the sharing of excess wood waste from businesses and individuals with those in need, fostering a sustainable and generous community.
   
2. **Resource Optimization**: Reduce wood waste by efficiently connecting surplus wood resources with individuals or organizations requiring materials for projects.
   
4. **Real-time Updates**: Provides admin to make  updates on available food resources, enabling users to quickly find matches and streamline the sharing process.
   
5. **Admin interface**: Allow users ( restauraunts, bakeries, markets ) to create profiles where they can add they are ready to share for a simbolic price with people in need.
   
6. **Recipe-generator**:  currently is random recipe generator (  Spoonacular API, but planning to add generator that gives recipes based on ingredients "bought" on webapp.
  
 7. **Mobile-Friendly Interface**: Although is primarily web-app, it is also fully functional and responsive on mobile devices ( some more changes will be added with time )
  8. **Integration with Sustainable Initiatives**: Currently is just a project for  study purposed,but further plan is to become partner with local sustainability initiatives, restauraunts, bakeries etc. with goal to reduce the waste of food , expand outreach and promote environmental and social awareness.

These key features highlight the core functionalities and benefits of  web app, emphasizing its role in promoting sustainable and generous sharing of food waste within the community.
